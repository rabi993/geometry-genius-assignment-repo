        <h2 class="text-3xl text-center text-cyan-600 py-4 font-semibold ">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
        <p class="text-center font-semibold ">DOM means Document Object Model. It is a programming interface provided by web browsers. Its purpose is to represent and manipulate the structure, content, and style of documents written in markup languages like HTML, XML, and XHTML.
            <br> 
            The purposes of the DOM are as follows: Document representation; Dynamic content;  Event handling; Cross-platform and Cross-language compatibility; Accessibility.
             

        </p> 
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-center text-cyan-600 py-4 font-semibold ">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
        <p class="text-center font-semibold ">I will select HTML elements  5 ways by using DOM. <br>
            There are :
            <br>
            getElementsByTagName() ;<br>
            getElementsByClassName();<br>
            getElementById();<br>
            querySelector(); and<br>
            querySelectorAll().</p> 
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-center text-cyan-600 py-4 font-semibold ">3. What is event bubble?</h2> 
        <p class="text-center font-semibold ">Event bubble is a method of event propagation in the HTML DOM API when an event is in an element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle to that event. <br>
            It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy. <br>
            In event bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.</p>
        <h2 class="text-3xl text-center text-cyan-600 py-4 font-semibold ">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2> 
        <p class="text-center font-semibold ">A callback function is any reference to executable code that is passed as an argument to another piece of code; that code is expected to call back & execute the callback function as part of its job. <br>
            I will use callback function. Because, it will make it easier to call  the function one after another. It keeps us safe  from problems and errors.
